                        A jersey printing machine works by transferring the design or colour onto
                        the fabric using heat, pressure, and ink.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-1">
                        <span className="font-bold">1. Design Preparation:</span> The design is
                        first made on a computer using software like Photoshop or CorelDraw.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-1">
                        <span className="font-bold">2. Printing on Transfer Paper:</span> The design
                        is printed on special sublimation paper using sublimation ink.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-1">
                        <span className="font-bold">3. Placing on Fabric:</span> The printed paper
                        is placed on the jersey cloth (polyester or synthetic fabric).
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-2">
                        <span className="font-bold">4. Heat Pressing:</span> The heat press machine
                        gives high temperature (around 180–200°C) and pressure for a few seconds.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-2">
                        <span className="font-bold">5. Colour Transfer:</span> The heat turns the
                        ink into gas and the colour transfers permanently onto the fabric fibers.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-2">
                        <span className="font-bold">6. Final Product:</span> The paper is removed,
                        and the design remains bright, washable, and long-lasting on the jersey.
                    </p>
                    <p className="italic mt-5">
                        <span className="font-bold">Note:</span> A jersey printing machine uses heat
                        and pressure to transfer the ink design from paper to fabric — this process
                        is called sublimation printing.
